# Installation

Next, we’ll set up a local installation of the Imandra client - we recommend you follow through the rest of the documentation with the client running and type out the examples yourself, in order to help things stick as you learn them.

# Installer (macOS and Linux only)

If you’re new to the OCaml ecosystem, the simplest way to go from zero to a working Imandra installation is to use the [Imandra installer](Installation%20-%20Simple.md).

# Docker Image

If you don't want to bother with setting up a native environment, you can use our [docker image](Installation%20-%20Docker.md)

# VSCode

Once you've got a working Imandra installation, you may find it helpful to [install our VSCode extension](Installation%20-%20VSCode.md) to aid development.
