# Installation

We offer several ways to install Imandra:


- [Installer (macOS and Linux only)](Installation%20-%20Simple.md): If youâ€™re new to the OCaml ecosystem, the simplest way to go from zero to a working Imandra installation is to use the Imandra installer.

- [Opam (macOS and Linux only)](Installation%20-%20Manual.md): If you have the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager available, you can install Imandra using our public opam repo.

- [Docker Image](Installation%20-%20Docker.md): If you don't want to bother with setting up a native environment, you can use our docker image.

- [Jupyter Notebook](Installation%20-%20Jupyter.md): If you'd rather use Imandra via a Jupyter Notebook rather than our REPL, check out the Jupyter Notebook setup.

- Add-ons:

  - [VSCode extension](Installation%20-%20VSCode.md): Once you've got a working Imandra installation, you may find it helpful to install our VSCode extension to aid development.
