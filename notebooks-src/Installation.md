# Installation

We offer several ways to install Imandra:

- [Installer](Installation%20-%20Simple.md): If youâ€™re new to the Imandra, the Imandra CLI is the simplest way to get access to Imandra Core and our Imandra Cloud APIs.

- [OPAM](Installation%20-%20Manual.md): If you have the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager available, you can install Imandra OCaml components using our public opam repo.

- [Docker Image](Installation%20-%20Docker.md): If you don't want to bother with setting up a native environment for Imandra's OCaml components, you can use our docker image.

- [Jupyter Notebook](Installation%20-%20Jupyter.md): If you'd rather use Imandra Core via a Jupyter Notebook rather than our REPL, check out the Jupyter Notebook setup.

- Add-ons:

  - [VSCode extension](Installation%20-%20VSCode.md): Once you've got a working Imandra Core installation, you may find it helpful to install our VSCode extension to aid development.
